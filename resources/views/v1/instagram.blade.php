   <p class="about-content" style="text-align:justify">Hi,
We worked for a month with a local IT company to optimize our website from SEO standpoint. We believe they created our Instagram handle. Now we have discontinued their contract due to bad performance. We are asking them to give back credentials of our Instagram handle (indiashopps) there are denying that.  Request urgent help so that we can secure our account and start actively using the same. My email ID that I have provided above is of the domain (indiashopps) itself. We can also add any verification code on the site that u may want in case u want to verify our domain.</p>
   <p class="about-content">We also created : www.indiashopps.com/instagram</p>
   <p class="about-content">Looking forward for HELP. </p> 
   <h3 style="font-size: 20px;margin-top: 0px;">Thanks & Regards,</h3>
