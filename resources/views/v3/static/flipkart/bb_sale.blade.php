                The Big Billion Day Sale is back. The punch line this time is "Itne mein Itnaa" .
                As consumers we hope this time Flipkart team has done all the homework to perfection. Unlike the first
                time when site got crashed and deliveries were not done. Moreover, some users also spotted artificial
                price increase just to show high discounts. In this scenario comparative sites like www.indiashopps.com
                comes pretty handy. All user have to do is compare the price before they hit the buy button. There can
                be further reduction if users get discount coupons codes vouchers clubbed with cashback from SBI Credit
                Debit cards. The online shopping experience with the crazy deals should be a pleasant one. After all its
                festive season , the mood should be festive.
