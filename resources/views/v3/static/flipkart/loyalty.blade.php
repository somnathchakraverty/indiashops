Over that, India's largest online retail company is set to spend approximately $173 million for this 'Flipkart Plus' loyalty programme for the next three years. As Flipkart's first innovative, 'Flipkart First' was a flop, the 'Flipkart Plus' has been planned with complete research and data analysis from the scratch. Moreover, the Flipkart believes that the 'Flipkart Plus' is more of a customer-benefit programme rather than a loyalty programme.</p>
                <strong>Unlike Amazon Prime, Flipkart Plus will not entail subscription fees.  </strong>
                <p>Unlike Amazon Prime, Flipkart's loyalty programme will not have any kind of monthly or annual subscription fees.

                <strong>Which one is better Amazon Prime or Flipkart Plus</strong>
                <p>Both the programs are meant to increase the Loyalty of the users. On face of it they promise faster delivery , early access to deals and promotions etc. However, since Amazon has Video and Music streaming business which comes bundled with Prime membership hence it scores few more points that Flipkart Plus. Having said that its early days for Plus. It will be an interesting competition to watchout for but the clear winner will be users for sure.</p>
